## Preface 
Code of ethics are on the surface are a simple way of outlining ethical guidelines for businesses practices and decisions. In truth, they often fall flat by creating a moral guideline that does not resonate with the moral beliefs of those who are meant to follow. Most code of ethics pick and chose different portions of moral frameworks, adhering to various principle as they see fit. As a result, there is no uniform foundation in which to support its principles. This code of ethics seeks to address this issue by defining five principles that are fundamental to morally sound design decisions. It then reasons these five principles within the lense of four major ethical frameworks: virtue, duty, freedom and welfare. Those reading this code of ethics are free to seek the ethical frameworks that resonate most closely with them, and then reason through the principles within that perspective. Adhering to all five virtues as a whole instead of individually is what will provide the most morally sound design decisions.    

### Covenant
> I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will observe these five principles as a whole in their many forms through the lense of virtue, duty, freedom, and welfare; I may add more if I wish, but never remove or contradict these core principles. These five principles are excellence, fortitude, integrity, respect, and responsibility.
