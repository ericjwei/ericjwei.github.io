 # Virtue of Person | Virtue of Action | Freedom | Welfare   

> I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: 

Below are the 5 virtues that should guide all design decisions. Each virtue is described under the lense of Virtue of Person, Virtue of Action, Freedom, and Welfare, along with a description and example. 

## The Lense of Virtue of Person:
### * Commitment
Designers should resolve to build with the best of their ability a solution with the core user problem always in mind. 

### * Fortitude
Designers should resist pressure from society, competition and peers to stray from ethical guidelines, and stand up for what is ethically right.

### * Integrity
Designers should be transparent and honest with all parties involved or affected in the product's management of risks and handling of sensitive assets.  

### * Respect
Designers should treat their users and coworkers as fellow humans with the same rights and freedoms as themselves.

### * Responsible
Designers should be accountable for the impact of their projects on their users and society.

Following virtue ethics, designers should always strive to fulfill these 5 virtues and help others to achieve them as well. This list does not in any way describe the ranking of desirability. It is as a group
that together form a core set of virtues for designers. In fact, other virtues that align with the company can be added so long as they do not contradict or weaken these core virtues. 

## The Lense of Virtue of Action:
### * Commitment
Commitment leads to continuous development, which in turns cultivates trust with the users. Designers should stay committed to the fundamental user problem that birthed the product. Otherwise, proper development would stop and the product would fail.

### * Fortitude
Moral actions should stay consistent regardless of social or economical influences. These virtues will hold true in all scenarios, and thus should be observed in all scenarios.

### * Integrity
Descriptions and agreements from the application should be truthful and not misleading to the user or else no users would believe in any product description or agreements. 

### * Respect
Designers should help users as an end goal and not use the users to achieve some other means. All design decisions should reflect this end goal.

### * Responsible
Designer should ensure that the impact of their product helps the users and does not harm them in any way, be it directly or indirectly. This ensures the users stay as the means of an end.

## The Lense of Freedom:
### * Commitment
Designers should have the freedom to design with the best of their ability a product that they believe will help a user problem, and see through to the completion of said product.

### * Fortitude
Designers should have the freedom to act in these 5 virtues, regardless of social or economical influences that push them otherwise.

### * Integrity
Designers should provide the freedom for users choose whether to interact with the product, along with a transparent overview of the product functions.

### * Respect
Designers should not restrict the freedom of users and coworkers. 

### * Responsible

## The Lense of Welfare:
